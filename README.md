# openstack-autoscaling

A set of HEAT templates and ansible playbooks to deploy a docker swarm cluster. 
Only one docker swarm manager is currently supported and an etcd cluster is needed to bootstra the swam.

As the name of the project suggests, the cluster should be autoscaling (not ready yet).
